Android Application for multi-language translation.

Developed in Kotlin, it makes use of Google's MLKit to provide a smart translation service using Machine Learning Models.


This app can listen to a speech, automatically identify the language, produce a translation to the selected language, and then, using text-to-speech speak the translated speech.


It also uses the device's Camera capabilities, it can, using MLKit API, detect text in a live camera feed and then translate the detected text into another language.


The language models can be downloaded or removed at the user's discretion.
